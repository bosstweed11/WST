An endless game where an octopus collects coins, avoids rocks and fireballs. And can be armed with a gun! He can't ink himself but he can use a pen if he finds some ink to douse the fire.


A game I made by asking some friends for 3 adjectives, they ended up starting with W, S, and T. 

The game is an endless point scoring game where coins will fall from the top in waves. these waves have several distinct patterns.
Each coin is worth a point and if the player gets all the coins in a wave, they will receive 5 bonus points. If they collect all of the coins
from consecutive waves they will receive 5*#of consecutive waves points. so on the 4th consecutive wave the bonus is 20 instead of 5.

The player can acquire 3 different items, A gun, a pen, and a shield.

The gun can be shot with the spacebar and bullets will go up, destroying falling rocks that could've killed the player.

The pen can be inked with the spacebar and ink will go down, destroying rising fireballs that could've killed the player.

The shield will remain around the player until they get hit, in which case the shield is lost, if the player is hit without a shield, the game is lost.


Sounds from the game were ripped off of the Blizzard game Hearthstone, they fit will and seemed like a fun way to add character.

After pulling this repo, doubleclick the jar and the game should start right up!

Have fun

The game was quickly done, in an effort to produce a game while working on a separate, larger game. It was a confidence thing to complete a smaller game to get something done in order to know that the other larger game, could be finshed. 

Because this game gave the motivation needed to continue, there are a lot of loose ends I may or may not clean up, including...

1.) centering menu text
2.) adding an arrow to indicate where the user is in the menu selection
3.) smoothing text when the game starts not just after a death
4.) make the game more difficult as it goes on so its not so boring
